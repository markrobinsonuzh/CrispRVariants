Description: CrispRVariants provides tools for analysing the results of a 
    CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis sequencing experiment, or other sequencing
    experiments where variants within a given region are of interest.  These
    tools allow users to localize variant allele combinations with respect to
    any genomic location (e.g. the Cas9 cut site), plot allele combinations
    and calculate mutation rates with flexible filtering of unrelated variants.
